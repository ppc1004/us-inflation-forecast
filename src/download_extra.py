"""Download supporting FRED series used by the website.

Writes one monthly, wide CSV (data/extra_series.csv) with a column per series.
Daily and weekly series (breakeven and TIPS yields, mortgage rates) are averaged by month.
If a single series fails to download, its previous values are kept so one
bad request never wipes a chart off the site.
